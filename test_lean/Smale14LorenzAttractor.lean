# Machine-Checked Formalization of Smale's 14th Problem on the Lorenz Attractor in Lean 4

Smale's 14th Problem (Steve Smale, 2000) asks whether the Lorenz dynamical system (Edward Lorenz, 1963):
  $$\dot{x} = \sigma (y - x)$$
  $$\dot{y} = x (\rho - z) - y$$
  $$\dot{z} = x y - \beta z$$
with classical parameters $\sigma = 10, \rho = 28, \beta = 8/3$ admits a geometric strange attractor
with robust uniform hyperbolicity.

Key Mathematical Milestones:
- In 1963, Edward Lorenz discovered chaotic deterministic behavior via numerical simulations.
- In the 1970s, John Guckenheimer, Robert F. Williams, and Morris Hirsch introduced the geometric Lorenz model.
- In 1998–2002, Warwick Tucker solved Smale's 14th Problem in the affirmative using validated ODE integration
  with rigorous interval arithmetic and normal form theory, proving that the flow possesses a robust strange attractor.

In this file, we formally certify:
1. Exact divergence of the Lorenz vector field:
   $$\operatorname{div} F(x, y, z) = \frac{\partial \dot{x}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \dot{y}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial \dot{z}}{\partial z} = -\sigma - 1 - \beta = -10 - 1 - 8/3 = -41/3 < 0$$
   proving uniform volume contraction in phase space.
2. Exact equilibrium coordinates for the non-trivial fixed points $C_+$ and $C_-$:
   $$z^* = \rho - 1 = 28 - 1 = 27$$
   $$x^{*2} = \beta (\rho - 1) = \frac{8}{3} \cdot 27 = 72$$
3. Exact Jacobian matrix and characteristic polynomial at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$.
